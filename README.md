## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm

### Local Development

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cybercharl/newlands-cottages-website.git
    cd newlands-cottages-website
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start a hot-reloading development server, typically at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Development and Deployment Workflow

This project uses a simplified trunk-based development model (GitHub Flow).

1.  **Create a Feature Branch:** All new work (features, fixes, content updates) must be done in a branch created from `main`. Use a descriptive name.

    ```bash
    # Example for a new feature
    git checkout -b feature/add-photo-gallery

    # Example for a bug fix
    git checkout -b fix/correct-phone-number
    ```

2.  **Commit Changes:** Make your changes and commit them with clear, concise messages.

3.  **Open a Pull Request:** When your work is complete, push the branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch.

4.  **Review and Stage:** A Netlify Deploy Preview link will be automatically generated and posted as a comment in your PR. Use this link to review your changes in a live, staging-like environment.

5.  **Merge to Production:** Once the PR is approved, merge it into `main` using the **"Squash and Merge"** option on GitHub. This keeps the `main` branch history clean and atomic.

6.  **Automatic Deployment:** Merging to `main` automatically triggers a production deployment via Netlify.
