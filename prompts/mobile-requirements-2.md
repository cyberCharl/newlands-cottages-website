Cottage Page Mobile Layout Design


Here is a breakdown of a robust implementation based on the carousel concept:


1. 
The Main Image Viewer:


	- Positioned directly below the <h1>The Cottage</h1> heading.
	- It displays one large, high-quality image that fills the width of the content area.
	- Interaction: It must be horizontally swipeable on touch devices.
2. 
UI Indicators (Crucial for UX):


	- Dot Indicators: Place a series of small dots (● ○ ○ ○) overlaid near the bottom of the image. This is a universal signifier that shows the user (a) there are multiple images and (b) their current position in the sequence.
	- "Next/Previous" Arrows (Optional but Recommended): For accessibility and non-touch users, subtle arrow buttons can be overlaid on the left and right edges of the image. These can be hidden on mobile and only appear on hover on desktop.
3. 
Click-to-Enlarge Functionality:


	- The carousel itself serves as the primary gallery. However, you should still implement the "click-to-enlarge" feature you planned.
	- When a user taps the current image in the carousel, it should open a full-screen modal gallery.
	- This modal would have a dark background, display the image even larger, hide the phone's status bar if possible, and allow swiping through the entire collection without any other UI distractions. It must have a clear "Close" (X) button.
This creates a two-level viewing experience: a quick, embedded "preview" carousel for casual browsing while reading, and an immersive full-screen gallery for users who are seriously interested.
