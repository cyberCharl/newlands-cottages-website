# **Our Story**

### **Preserving Heritage, Creating Comfort**

Newlands Cottages has been welcoming guests since 2005. In 2014, Clarkia Cottage underwent a significant renovation to enhance the living space and add a second bathroom, all while respecting the building's heritage status and its unique location opposite the presidential residence. Our mission has always been to stay true to the original style of the cottage, with its beautiful Oregon wood floors and original doors, while fitting in as much modern comfort as possible. The decorating style is "Shabby Chic," a look that perfectly suits the cottage's history. We've used techniques from Annie Sloan to create a space that feels both authentic and lovingly curated.

### **The Heart of the Southern Suburbs**

Our cottage is nestled in the unique and leafy community of Rondebosch/Newlands. Situated directly below the iconic Table Mountain, we are within walking distance of beautiful mountain trails, Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, and the University of Cape Town (UCT). The location provides an ideal base for exploring, with the city centre, V&A Waterfront, and Muizenberg beaches all just an easy drive away.
