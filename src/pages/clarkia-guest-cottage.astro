        Clarkia Cottage is a beautifully restored 2-bedroom heritage cottage
        providing comfortable accomodation for up to four guests. The main
        bedroom features a king-size bed and a full en-suite bathroom. The
        second bedroom contains two single beds access to a shower-only
        bathroom. The open-plan living area is designed for relaxation,
        featuring a charming combustion wood fireplace and a smart TV with
        streaming services over reliable WiFi. An inverter and battery-operated
        lights are available if there is loadshedding. The kitchen is
        thoughtfully equipped for all your self-catering needs, including a
        two-ring gas hob, convection/microwave oven, air fryer, and a full-size
        fridge/freezer. We have a Nespresso machine for coffee lovers. A kettle
        and toaster are also provided. Step outside to a small, tranquil front
        garden or enjoy the private back patio, complete with a Weber braai for
        outdoor cooking and a washing machine for laundry. Dedicated parking is
        available on the wide, paved verge in front of the property, suitable
        for one vehicle.
