      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <h2>Preserving Heritage, Creating Comfort</h2>
      <p>
        Newlands Cottages has been welcoming guests since 2005. In 2014, Clarkia
        Cottage underwent a significant renovation to enhance the living space
        and add a second bathroom, all while respecting the building's heritage
        status and its unique location opposite the presidential residence. Our
        mission has always been to stay true to the original style of the
        cottage, with its beautiful Oregon wood floors and original doors, while
        fitting in as much modern comfort as possible. The decorating style is
        "Shabby Chic," a look that perfectly suits the cottage's history. We've
        used techniques from Annie Sloan to create a space that feels both
        authentic and lovingly curated.

      <h2>The Heart of the Southern Suburbs</h2>
      <p>
        Our cottage is nestled in the unique and leafy community of
        Rondebosch/Newlands. Situated directly below the iconic Table Mountain,
        we are within walking distance of beautiful mountain trails,
        Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, and the University of Cape Town (UCT).
        The location provides an ideal base for exploring, with the city centre,
        V&A Waterfront, and Muizenberg beaches all just an easy drive away.
